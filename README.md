# Hardware-Software Interface

The projects in this class were focused on intensive memory management and doing bitwise operators on binary strings.

This class followed the text Hardware-Software Interface, Intro to Assembly ARM edition, in which I read through front to back and took notes excessively, to where anyone can read my notes and follow along to learn the material. 

## Insertion Sort

Tasked with creating a version of insertion sort that was split into multiple different functions into legv8 assembly (C code for the insertion sort found in cs321_insertion_sort.c.) The code runs on the legv8emulator and correctly initializes the heap & stack, then sorts with insertion sort, and finally performs multiple interations of a binary search to ensure sort correctness. Earned perfect score.

## Binary Disassembler

The second assignment was to implement the instruction fetch & decode stage in a binary emulator. My implementation was done with an OOP paradigm in python so it can be scaled to the full binary emulator. Bitwise manipulation to extract instruction information were required (instead of string manipulation.) Worked solo (could have had teams of 3) and earned another perfect score.
